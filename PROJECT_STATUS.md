## 🔧 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. No real-time updates (requires WebSocket implementation)
2. Single-file SQLite database (may need optimization for large datasets)
3. No image upload for book covers
4. No barcode/QR code support
5. Basic search (could be enhanced with full-text search)
6. No data import/export (except CSV reports)

### Technical Debt
1. Frontend state management could use Zustand for complex state
2. Form validation needs react-hook-form integration
3. Need comprehensive error boundaries
4. Missing accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
5. No internationalization (i18n) support
